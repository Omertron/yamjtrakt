YAMJ Trakt App

This simple GUI can be used to upload your existing YAMJ library to Trakt.tv
The movies and tv shows will be read from the CompleteMovies.xml file in your
jukebox and uploaded to the website. If you have the shows marked as watched,
then they will be marked as "seen" on Trakt.tv too.
Any files not marked as watched will just be added to your collection.
